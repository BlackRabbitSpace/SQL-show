# Documentaion_SQL_CodeMosh
Code with Mosh SQL for Begginers 
This is a documentation of the course applied by the youtuber Mosh on his channel. Because all the course material plus the video lessons are in English, I did the translation to make it easier for Brazilians and Portuguese people to have an easier time with the content. The course develops basic principles of Relational Database manipulation, using DBMS MySQL to data structure and relationship manipulation. Queries can be used on several database platforms.
If you want to learn more about DBA technologies, here's a tip. Until next time folks.
